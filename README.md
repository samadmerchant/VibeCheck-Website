# VibeCheck-Website
I function as Vibe Check's SCM and CTO. I developed the website on my own using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively while still being in charge of final decisions when it comes to large purchases from vendors.  Essentially, the new George Ranch High School principal is enforcing a strict rule forcing all students to wear lanyards along with ID cards to ensure school safety. Many students are against this change as they find it tedious to bring such items with them to school everyday. In order to solve this problem, Vibe Check provides students with customized lanyards while also providing them with an assortment of buttons and stickers to tack onto their new or even old lanyards.
